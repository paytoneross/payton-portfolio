                <div class="black col-md-8">
                    <p>I am currently a sophmore/junior at Boise State University
                        studying Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile Technologies (GIMM). I say sophmore/junior because I am fast tracking through the
                        program and I am anticipated to graduate in Spring 2026 after 3 years of schooling. I am very excited to have found a career where 
                        I love what I do and I am eager to contribute something meaningful to the industry. 
                    </p>
                    <p>In my time away from school, I work as a Phlebotmist. I used to be a nursing major before I switched to GIMM, and </p>
                    <p>In my free time I enjoy spending time with my friends and family, playing music, playing video games, snowboarding, 
                        skateboarding, wakeboarding, any type of boarding really.</p>

                    <p id="subtitle">First Individual Game</p>
                    <p>This was the first project that I worked on in the program. I was just starting working in Unity and in Animate, as you can 
                        see from my state of the art animation and shading. We had to chose one of three 2D stub games, a platformer, 
                        tower defense, or top down shooter, and make our own game out of them. I chose the platformer, and I decided to create a 
                        game that combines platforming challenges with metroidvania-like exploration and progression. The player explores the interior 
                        of a scary haunted pyramid, and has find movement upgrades in order to survive and escape. My initial idea for the game was much 
                        grander than I ended up being able to make, but I'm still proud of what I came up with. The biggest things I took from this game
                        were avoiding out-scoping myself, and what makes a small game punch above its weight class. When I look back on this game now, all
                        that I see is everything that is wrong with it and how much better I could do it now, which I think that shows how far I've come. 
                        Below is a trailer that I made for this game in my current Interactive Audio/Video class.

                    <p id="subtitle">Interactive Comic</p>
                    <p>In this project, we were tasked with creating a comic that explained a complex quantum science theory. For our group, it was the bi-directional flow of time.
                        Given how complex our topic is, we decided to make a story where we apply this concept to a character narrative and show the effects that this theory could
                        hypothetically have on someone. My contributions to this project was 4 comic panels, story/dialogue writing, Unity implementation, and I created the mini game. 
                        The mini game is an auto runner where the player is traveling backwards in time. To visually emphasize this, the player runs to the left instead of the right.
                        The class we were in was all about visual storytelling, the ways that people percieve information, and methods to subtly convey meaning without people realizing.
                        We thought a lot about how to create a powerful story that displays this topic in a way that the average person can understand and sympathize with. Everyone at some 
                        point wishes that they could go back in time and change things about their past, the laws of physics technically don't disallow this, but this comic emphasizes the 
                        importance of playing with the cards you are dealt, and being grateful you were dealt cards in the first place. Below are two videos, one of me explaning the project
                        and my contributions in more detail, and one of a full playthrough of our comic.

                    <p id="subtitle">AR Group Project</p>
                    <p>This was the second game I developed in my first semester, and the first group game project I worked on in the program. The assignment was to make an 
                        AR game experience that could be played on a mobile device. After a few brainstorming sessions, we decided on an FPS where you would spawn a castle using
                        plane detection and once you do a bunch of tiny guys start shooting at you. The goal is to clear them all out while dodging their shots by moving around.
                        My contribution to this project was assisting with AR implementation, the design of the castle, the shooting mechanics, UI/UX and HUD design.
                        We only had a few weeks to put this project together, and I'm very proud of what we made and how much we learned in such a short amount of time. 
                        My biggest takeaways from this project was the value of working on projects as a team. They say teams are stronger than heroes, and that was proven to me
                        when we worked on this project. I unfortunately don't have a decent video of the final build, due to difficulties recording on the android tablets
                        we were using, but below is a video of our nearly finalized game build. Just imagine this but on a phone, the little dudes actually behind cover, 
                        the background is transparent, and this is appearing in a 3D space.
